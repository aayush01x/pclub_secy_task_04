       "[{'abstract': 'Kerry said that he had intended the remark as a jab at President Bush, and described the remarks as a \\\\\"botched joke\\\\\", having inadvertently left out the key word \\\\\"us\\\\\" (which would have been, \\\\\"If you don\\\\\\'t, you get us stuck in Iraq\\\\\"), as well as leaving the phrase \\\\\"just ask President Bush\\\\\" off of the end of the sentence. In Kerry\\\\\\'s prepared remarks, which he released during the ensuing media frenzy, the corresponding line was \\\\\"... you end up getting us stuck in a war in Iraq. Just ask President Bush.\\\\\" He also said that from the context of the speech which, prior to the \\\\\"stuck in Iraq\\\\\" line, made several specific references to Bush and elements of his biography, that Kerry was referring to President Bush and not American troops in general.'},\n",
       " {'abstract': 'In the lead up to the Iraq War, Kerry said on October 9, 2002; \\\\\"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\\\\\" Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003 speech to Georgetown University saying \\\\\"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real.\\\\\" Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: \\\\\"Mr. President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it\\\\\\'s not winning the war that\\\\\\'s hard, it\\\\\\'s winning the peace that\\\\\\'s hard.\\\\\"'},\n",
       " {'abstract': 'The first debate was held on September 30 at the University of Miami, moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS. During the debate, slated to focus on foreign policy, Kerry accused Bush of having failed to gain international support for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, saying the only countries assisting the U.S. during the invasion were the United Kingdom and Australia. Bush replied to this by saying, \\\\\"Well, actually, he forgot Poland.\\\\\" Later, a consensus formed among mainstream pollsters and pundits that Kerry won the debate decisively, strengthening what had come to be seen as a weak and troubled campaign. In the days after, coverage focused on Bush\\\\\\'s apparent annoyance with Kerry and numerous scowls and negative facial expressions.'},\n",
       " {'abstract': 'On July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate, shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, held later that month. Days before Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate, Kerry gave a short list of three candidates: Sen John Edwards, Rep Dick Gephardt, and Gov Tom Vilsack. Heading into the convention, the Kerry/Edwards ticket unveiled their new slogan—a promise to make America \\\\\"stronger at home and more respected in the world.\\\\\" Kerry made his Vietnam War experience the prominent theme of the convention. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, \\\\\"I\\\\\\'m John Kerry and I\\\\\\'m reporting for duty.\\\\\" He later delivered what may have been the speech\\\\\\'s most memorable line when he said, \\\\\"the future doesn\\\\\\'t belong to fear, it belongs to freedom\\\\\", a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement.'},\n",
       " {'abstract': 'Bush focused his campaign on national security, presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a \\\\\"flip-flopper.\\\\\" This strategy was designed to convey to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be \\\\\"uncertain in the face of danger.\\\\\" Bush (just as his father did with Dukakis in the 1988 election) also sought to portray Kerry as a \\\\\"Massachusetts liberal\\\\\" who was out of touch with mainstream Americans. One of Kerry\\\\\\'s slogans was \\\\\"Stronger at home, respected in the world.\\\\\" This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns; it also encapsulated Kerry\\\\\\'s contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy.'}]"
